Angular Waterfall
=================

This library generates a flow-chart based on simple one-directional parent-child relationships. It's ideal for representing non-recursive flows (hence the name ["waterfall"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)) like:
- grant/scholarship application
- sports tournament brackets
- decision tree
- so much more!
